# Java and Multiple Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties of more than one parent class. The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass. On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority. 


Java doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance

### Terms used in Inheritance:
Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.
